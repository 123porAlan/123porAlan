## Bio
Hello! I'm Alan

Since I was young, I had a natural curiosity for mathematics. Over time, that curiosity began to mix with bigger questions: what should I study?, how could I combine my interests?, and what does a car have to do with a Linux terminal?

My path was anything but straight: I considered automotive engineering (spoiler: it didn't exist at UNAM), then physics caught my eye (thanks, The Big Bang Theory), but nothing fully convinced me... until I stumbled upon a subject called Cybernetics in my last semester of high school.

There, I met a professor who not only taught well but also inspired me. I wrote him an email, he responded with humility, and gave me two great pieces of advice: study Computer Science and try GNU/Linux. I did both. Installing Linux Mint was love at first terminal: ever since then, I've been using and exploring the world of free software.

Nowadays:
- I am interested in growing professionally as a QA.
- I continue to explore Linux, scripting, and everything related to Testing and Cloud.
- I really enjoy theater, poetry, and going for runs in the morning.
- My sports combo: track and field + basketball

What's next?

I'm still learning, growing, and looking for new challenges. If we share interests (Cloud, Linux, dev testing, poetry, or just pretty scripts), don't hesitate to reach out.
