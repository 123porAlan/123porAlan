## Bio
Hello! I'm Alan

Current QA at S4learning with two years of experience in testing at Asdrome, always learning. I could tell you what I'm capable of, but that's not the point, because things aren't just said, they're done, and when they're done, they say themselves.

Nowadays:
- I am interested in growing professionally as a QA.
- I continue to explore Linux, scripting, and everything related to Testing and Cloud.
- I really enjoy theater, poetry, and going for runs in the morning.
- My sports combo: track and field + basketball

What's next?

I'm still learning, growing, and looking for new challenges. If we share interests (Cloud, Linux, dev testing, poetry, or just pretty scripts), don't hesitate to reach out.
